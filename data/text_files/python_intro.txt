Key features include:
Dynamic Typing: Variable types are automatically determined at runtime, which simplifies coding.
Multiple Paradigms: It supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming styles.
Extensive Libraries: A vast ecosystem of libraries and the Python Package Index (PyPI) offer ready-to-use code for various tasks.
