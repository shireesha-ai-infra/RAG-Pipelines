Machine Learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that lets computers learn from data to find patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes, without being explicitly programmed for every task, using algorithms trained on vast datasets for tasks like image recognition, recommendations, and translation. Key types include Supervised Learning (labeled data, e.g., spam filters), Unsupervised Learning (unlabeled data, e.g., customer grouping), and Reinforcement Learning (learning via rewards/penalties for decision-making).
